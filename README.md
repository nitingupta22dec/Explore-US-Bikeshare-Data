# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics. 

Libraries that I've used in the Data Analysis Process: 
- matplotlib
- csv
